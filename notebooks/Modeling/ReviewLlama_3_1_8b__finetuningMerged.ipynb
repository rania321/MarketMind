        "\n",
        "In this project, we will use **Llama-3.1 8B**, a **Large Language Model (LLM)** developed by Meta, to automatically summarize customer reviews. The goal is to extract key insights for better marketing decisions and enhance understanding of customer needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer reviews provide valuable feedback but are often lengthy and unstructured. Manually analyzing them is time-consuming, which is why automating the process is essential for actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Llama-3.1 8B** is a powerful pre-trained model capable of understanding, summarizing, and generating text. It helps identify sentiments, strengths, and weaknesses in customer feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps:\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and structure the reviews.\n",
        "2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune **Llama-3.1 8B** on customer reviews.\n",
        "3. **Evaluation**: Compare the model-generated summaries with human ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project explores how **LLMs** can transform customer review analysis, providing businesses with faster, more insightful data and improved customer strategies.\n"
